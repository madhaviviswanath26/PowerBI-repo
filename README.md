# Sales & Revenue Dashboard – Power BI Practice Project

## About the Project
This is a Power BI dashboard I built to explore sales and revenue data across different markets, customers, and products. The goal was to practice building interactive visuals, working with DAX, and telling a clear story with data.

## Why I Made This
I wanted to get hands-on with Power BI and understand how businesses use dashboards to track performance. This project helped me learn how to:
- Clean and model data
- Create calculated measures
- Design visuals that actually make sense to decision-makers

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (for calculated columns and measures)
- Power Query (for data cleaning)
- MySQL (as the data source)

## Data Source
The dataset includes sales transactions with fields like:
- Market name
- Customer name
- Product name
- Quantity sold
- Revenue
It’s structured to allow filtering by year and month, and gives a good mix of regional and product-level insights.

## Dashboard Highlights
- **Top KPIs**: Total revenue and total sales quantity
- **Filters**: Year and month slicers for dynamic analysis
- **Market Breakdown**: Revenue and sales quantity by region
- **Trend Line**: Revenue over time (Jan 2018 to Jan 2020)
- **Top Customers & Products**: Who’s driving the most revenue

## Key Takeaways
- Delhi NCR is the top-performing market by far
- Electronics & Co. is the biggest customer
- Revenue is trending downward over time — something worth investigating
- There are some gaps in product naming (blank entries), which shows how important clean data is

## How to Use
Download the `.pbix` file and open it in Power BI Desktop. Play around with the filters and visuals to explore the data.

This project was a great way to sharpen my Power BI skills and understand how dashboards can drive business decisions.
